Hello World!
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Please bring your point down. Members, the House will stand at ease.
I rise to raise a point of order against further consideration of Senate Bill 4 under Rule 4, Section 32(c).
Ms. Ortega, for what purpose?
Ms. Howard, we have seen this in other places. We've seen this in other parts of the world. We've seen this in other parts of history and it never works out well. People are not meant to be hunted. People are not meant to feel hunted. Children are not meant to feel hunted and that is what Schaefer's amendment does. I ask that people support my amendment. Thank you.
Well, I appreciate what you're saying. I think there is a distinction that you're making here that this body needs to be aware of. There is a distinction between being arrested and being detained, lawfully detained even. There is a distinction and it is a slippery slope if we go beyond arrest, and allow something like this to happen. Sounds like that's what you're saying.
that people in the community will understand. What Mr. Schaefer is introducing and what my amendment aims to strike down is the moment where you never know when you'll find yourself in a situation where you come in contact with the police, whether you're guilty of anything or not. Whether you're suspected of anything or not, you can come in contact with the police or any other form of law enforcement and they can ask you to verify that you have legal status.
You never know who's next, but what I'll say is this. While I don't like any version of this bill, I understand starting at arrest, that is a clear threshold that everybody understands,
Why is it, why is it that it's okay to ask some people for their papers and not others? Really, I'm not worried about it for me at all. Should I be?
Yes, ma'am.
But it could be.
we never have to worry about showing our papers. We never have to worry about, will I not come home because I didn't have my papers to show. Because I had a faulty turn light or whatever the heck I might get stopped for. I hope it wouldn't be anything more than that.
I think there's other people in this chamber who look like me, who haven't ever had to worry about showing papers. I can go anywhere, my children can go anywhere. My grandchildren can go anywhere with me, and
Thank you. Mr. Bernal, show me your papers, I'm trying to imagine this here. I don't know that anybody has ever asked me for my papers. I'm trying to put myself in this position, and
He yields for questions.
Yes, I will yield.
Does the gentleman yield?
Will the gentleman yield?
